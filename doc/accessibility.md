# Accessibility Features

This document outlines the accessibility goals and planned features for this project.

## Overview

The project aims to make the website fully accessible to all users, including individuals with disabilities. Accessibility is a core value of this project, ensuring that creative work can be experienced by everyone, regardless of ability.

Because accessibility implementation can be technically complex, this initiative invites community collaboration to improve inclusivity and usability across the site.

## Contribution

Community members are encouraged to contribute to accessibility improvements.  
You can:
- Submit ideas or feature requests through the **Issues** section.
- Fork the repository, implement new accessibility features, and submit a **Pull Request (PR)** for review.

All contributions are reviewed and discussed transparently. The goal is to build a shared ecosystem where accessibility evolves with community input.

## Planned Features

Below is a list of accessibility features that are planned or under consideration:

- **Alternative font** — Integrate the [Open Dyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/) font option for users with dyslexia.
- **Adjustable text size** — Allow users to increase or decrease font size for better readability.
- **AI-generated audio content** — Provide AI-generated audio versions of articles (Blog, Projects, etc.) to assist users who are blind, visually impaired (including those with myopia), or have reading difficulties.
- **Additional features** — More accessibility options will be added based on user feedback and community contributions.

## Future Plans

Some accessibility features may require paid services or third-party integrations.  
In the future, a **Patreon** or similar funding option may be launched to support these efforts.  
All funding and data usage will remain fully transparent.

## AI Disclaimer

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are used in this project to enhance accessibility — primarily to generate audio versions of written content for users who are blind, visually impaired, or experience reading challenges.

> ⚠️ **Note:** AI-based accessibility features are currently **experimental** and may **not be implemented** when the first version of the website is released. They will be introduced progressively as development and testing continue.

### You are in control of accessibility features
Users can enable or disable AI-based accessibility functionalities from their account settings at any time.  
By default, all AI features are **disabled** when a new account is created to ensure user privacy and data protection.

## Legal & Ethical Notice

While AI tools are employed to improve accessibility, users should be aware of the following:

- AI-generated content (including audio transcriptions or narrations) may contain **minor inaccuracies** or **variations in tone**.
- Such content is **supplementary** and not intended to replace human-reviewed material.
- The project team makes every effort to ensure accessibility, accuracy, and ethical compliance, but **no warranty** is provided regarding the completeness or correctness of AI-generated content.
- By using this feature, users acknowledge that AI-based outputs are provided **for assistive purposes only** and may evolve as technology improves.
